            <h2>The argument</h2>
            <p>Most product work happens at the interface layer. Teams refine screens, polish flows, ship increments. The work is necessary. It's also commoditized.</p>
            <p>The work that differentiates—content architectures, intelligence layers, the logic that makes features inevitable—rarely has an owner. It falls between product and engineering, between strategy and design. It gets neglected because no role is accountable for it.</p>
            <p>I'm accountable for it.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The backstory</h2>
            <p>I'm <a href="mailto:strangelund.studio@gmail.com">James DiStefano</a>. Twenty-plus years designing digital experiences—agencies, SaaS, Fortune 500s, startups. I've led departments and built products and been on all sides of the table.</p>
            <p>Somewhere along the way, I stopped being a UX designer.</p>
            <p>Not because I left the field. Because the field narrowed around me. UX became screens in Figma, flows between states, design systems for projects that didn't need them. The role that was supposed to steward the vision for a project got reduced to one input among many.</p>
            <p>I still do the work I've always done: articulating strategic position, designing systems that support it, building infrastructure that makes differentiated outcomes possible. I just stopped pretending the title fit.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>I design the systems that make experiences possible.</p>
            <p>Content architectures that let one source publish everywhere. Intelligence layers that turn data into decisions. Probability models that know which moments matter. The logic underneath—not the screens on top.</p>
            <p>The title I've settled on: <strong>Principal Experience Architect</strong>. The work: making sure the layer that differentiates actually gets built.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I'm looking for</h2>
            <p>Green field. Weighty problems with no obvious solution. Appetite for risk. Aversion to parity.</p>
            <p>I want to work on things that produce something different—not things that catch up to competitors.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I don't do</h2>
            <p>Chase parity. Limit my contribution to screens, flows, and incremental UI changes. Craft the obvious and safe solution.</p>
            <p>If the ask is "make it look like the competitor but slightly better," I'm the wrong person.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Beyond the work</h2>
            <p>I rebuilt my 100-year-old house while living in it. (No, not optimal.) I trained to box open class and taught kettlebell for six years—my first client was NFL Pro Bowler Shannon Sharpe. I'm a proud former Athenian (the Georgia variety); Michael Stipe once stopped by band practice to say we sounded good.<sup>*</sup></p>
            <p>My wife describes my personal style as <em>Detroit 1974</em>—overly influenced by denim, 70s revolutionaries, and proto-punk.</p>
            <p class="footnote"><sup>*</sup> I was kicked out of the band soon after.</p>
