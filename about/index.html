          <section>
            <p>I'm <a href="mailto:strangelund.studio@gmail.com">James (Jim) DiStefano</a>. I've been designing digital experiences for over twenty years—leading departments, building products, working across Fortune 500s and startups.</p>
            <p>Somewhere along the way, I stopped being a UX designer.</p>
            <p>Not because I left the field. Because the field narrowed around me. UX became screens in Figma, flows between states, design systems for projects that didn't need them. The role that was supposed to hold vision got reduced to one input among many.</p>
            <p>I still do the work I've always done: articulating strategic position, designing the systems that support it, building infrastructure that makes differentiated outcomes possible. I just stopped pretending the title fit.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>I design systems that make experiences possible.</p>
            <p>Content architectures that let one source publish everywhere. Intelligence layers that turn data into decisions. Probability models that know which moments matter. The logic underneath—not the screens on top.</p>
            <p>I've settled (for now) on the title <strong>Principal, Systems and Experience Design</strong>.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I'm looking for</h2>
            <p>Green field. Weighty problems with no obvious solution. Appetite for risk. Aversion to parity.</p>
            <p>I want to work on things that produce something different, not things that catch up to competitors.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I don't do</h2>
            <p>Chase parity. Screens and flows. Incremental UI. Catch-up roadmaps. Design systems for single-page projects.</p>
