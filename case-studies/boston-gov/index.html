            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>City government websites are organized around government, not citizens.</p>
            <p>Boston.gov had content spread across 50 department sites—each with its own navigation, architecture, language. Where do I pay a parking ticket? Parking Services? Transportation? Treasury? What do I do when it snows? (There are literal fistfights over parking when it snows in Boston.) Does the department that handles tickets also prevent fistfights?</p>
            <p>Citizens don't think in departments. They think in problems.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The question:</strong> How do you reorganize a city's entire web presence around how people actually need help?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>Working with IDEO, I helped design a system that cuts across departmental silos.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Principles</h3>
            <p>Research revealed the core insight: citizens don't care about org charts. They care about getting things done. The positioning became simple: act as a helpful human. Every design decision filtered through that lens.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/boston-gov/principles.png" alt="Boston.gov strategic principles page showing 'Act as a helpful human' as the core principle">
              <figcaption>"Act as a helpful human." Context, reasonable, communication, direct. The principle that filtered every design decision.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Component Architecture</h3>
            <p>I designed a system of reusable components for the CMS—not page templates, but building blocks that could assemble into different configurations based on citizen need. Defined once, deployed everywhere.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/boston-gov/components-02.png" alt="CMS component wireframes showing modular building blocks for page assembly">
              <figcaption>Component wireframes for the CMS. Modular blocks that editors could assemble—no developer required for new page configurations.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Topic Pages</h3>
            <p>This was the key intervention. Instead of routing citizens through department navigation, topic pages organize content by problem—how a user thinks about it, not what department owns it.</p>
            <p>"Winter in Boston" pulls from multiple departments: parking rules, snow removal, heating assistance, school closings. One page. One mental model. Fifty departments, invisible.</p>
            <p>The system doesn't require departments to reorganize. It creates a citizen-facing layer on top of existing structure.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/boston-gov/topic-01.png" alt="Topic page wireframe showing content organized by citizen need rather than department">
              <figcaption>Topic page wireframe. Content from multiple departments, organized around a single citizen need. The org chart becomes invisible.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>The old model: citizens navigate bureaucracy. Government publishes by department. Finding information requires knowing how government is organized.</p>
            <p>The new model: <strong>government navigates itself.</strong> Citizens describe problems. The system assembles answers from wherever they live.</p>
            <p>Pilot. Beta. Full launch. Positive outcomes from city and citizens alike.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study shows the homepage and the topic page templates.</p>
            <p>This one is about the layer underneath: strategic principles that filter decisions, component architecture that enables flexibility, a content layer that makes fifty departments work as one.</p>
