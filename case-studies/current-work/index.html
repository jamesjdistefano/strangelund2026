            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>I am working on career-defining work that I can't currently talk about.</p>
            <p class="callout">Sensitivities around timing and non-disclosure prevent me from naming the company or describing the domain. What I can share is the shape of the system.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Analogy</h2>
            <p>Think about Pandora.</p>
            <p>Their intellectual property isn't the music—it's the Music Genome Project: a system of definitions encoded as data. Those definitions feed algorithms that power recommendation and advertising. The music is the surface. The genome is the system.</p>
            <p>What I've built operates similarly. We transform raw, live data streams into mathematical models. Those models become the foundation for systems of gaming and media.</p>
            <p>One intelligence layer. Multiple experience systems. Each feeding on the same underlying reality.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>Participation and narrative emerge from the same trigger, at the same moment, for the same reason.</p>
            <p>This is what I mean by designing systems, not features. The intelligence layer that powers games and media didn't exist before I proposed it. I brought the architecture; now it's become central to the product.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>This case study can't show you anything. NDA.</p>
            <p>But what I can tell you is what the work required: collaborating with data science to design the mathematical model, thinking through game mechanics that couple to live states, designing a content system that treats data shifts as editorial triggers for deploy.</p>
