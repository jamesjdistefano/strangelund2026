            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Most companies treat real-time data as a display problem.</p>
            <p>Charts. Feeds. Notifications. The data streams through. Nothing accumulates. Nothing compounds. You have a firehose pointed at a screen.</p>
            <p>The harder problem: how do you turn volatile data into durable intelligence? How do you make a system that doesn't just <em>react</em> to what's happening, but <em>understands</em> it well enough to trigger games, generate narratives, drive participation?</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>That's the system I'm building now.</strong></p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Shape</h2>
            <p>Think about Pandora. Their intellectual property isn't the music—it's the Music Genome Project: a system of definitions encoded as data. Those definitions feed algorithms that power recommendation and advertising. The music is the surface. The genome is the system.</p>
            <p>What I've designed operates similarly. Raw, live data streams transform into mathematical models. Those models become an intelligence layer. That layer powers multiple experience systems—games, media, participation mechanics—all feeding on the same underlying reality.</p>
            <p>One source of truth. Multiple expressions. Each reinforcing the others.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Before/After</h2>
            <p><strong>The old way:</strong> Real-time data powers a dashboard. Someone watches the dashboard. When something interesting happens, they decide what to do. Then they build it—a feature, a notification, a piece of content. By the time it ships, the moment has passed.</p>
            <p>This is how most companies work. Data informs decisions. Decisions trigger projects. Projects ship eventually. The data is an input to human judgment, not a trigger for system behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>The new way:</strong> The intelligence layer identifies meaningful states—thresholds, patterns, inflection points. When the data crosses a boundary, the system responds. A game mechanic activates. A narrative surfaces. A participation opportunity opens.</p>
            <p>No one decides. No one builds. The system already knows what matters and what to do about it.</p>
            <p>The difference isn't speed. It's architecture. One approach treats data as something to look at. The other treats data as something the system understands.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Why This Is Hard</h2>
            <p>Building this requires solving three problems at once:</p>
            <p><strong>The modeling problem:</strong> What states matter? Real-time data is noisy. Most of it is meaningless. The intelligence layer has to distinguish signal from noise—identifying the patterns that should trigger responses from the patterns that are just fluctuation.</p>
            <p><strong>The trigger problem:</strong> How do you connect states to experiences? A threshold crossing isn't inherently meaningful. It becomes meaningful when it activates something—a game, a story, a reason to participate. Designing those connections is systems design, not feature design.</p>
            <p><strong>The coherence problem:</strong> How do multiple experiences feed on the same reality without contradicting each other? If the game says one thing and the media says another, the whole system loses credibility. One source of truth, multiple expressions—but the expressions have to cohere.</p>
            <p>Most companies solve one of these. Few solve all three. The ones that do have something defensible.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Where This Goes</h2>
            <p>The pattern isn't domain-specific. Any company sitting on real-time data faces the same choice: display it or understand it. The ones who build the intelligence layer own something defensible. The ones who don't are competing on dashboard polish.</p>
            <p>This system is one implementation. The architecture is portable.</p>
            <p>The intelligence layer I designed didn't exist before I proposed it. Now it's central to the product. The next version of this pattern will be central to someone else's.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>What I can't tell you: the company, the domain, the specifics.</p>
            <p>What I can tell you: if you're sitting on real-time data and treating it as a display problem instead of an intelligence problem, you're leaving the system unbuilt. The data streams through. Nothing compounds. The opportunity sits there, unrealized.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>I designed the system that turns volatile data into compounding intelligence. If you have the data and don't have the system, let's talk.</strong></p>
