            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Email marketing platforms are dashboards for the past.</p>
            <p>Open rates. Click rates. Revenue attributed. Unsubscribes. Every ESP shows you what already happened—metrics that confirm or disappoint, but don't tell you what to do next.</p>
            <p>The dirty secret of email marketing software: it's incredibly powerful and almost no one uses it well. Small ecommerce businesses stare at dashboards full of data and still don't know the answer to the basic question: where am I losing customers, and what should I do about it?</p>
            <p>Drip had this problem. Klaviyo had this problem. Everyone had this problem. The platforms were competing on features—more automations, more integrations, more templates—while customers churned because they couldn't translate data into action.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The real gap:</strong> No system existed to turn behavioral metrics into marketing interventions.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I designed an intelligence layer that answers a different question than traditional ESP dashboards.</p>
            <p>Not "what happened?" but <strong>"where should you intervene, and what should you do?"</strong></p>

            <h3>The Underlying Model</h3>
            <p>I started with The Hawke Method framework and extracted the metrics that actually predict revenue impact:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Time to first purchase:</strong> How long from signup to first conversion?</li>
              <li><strong>Customer lifetime value:</strong> What's a customer worth across their entire relationship?</li>
              <li><strong>Journey stage indicators:</strong> Where in the customer lifecycle is someone, and what does movement (or stagnation) at each stage mean?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These metrics aren't new. What's new is using them as the basis for a system that identifies intervention points.</p>

            <h3>The Logic Layer</h3>
            <p>Traditional ESPs say: "Here's your dashboard. Here are your segments. Here are your automations. Good luck."</p>
            <p>The system I designed inverts this. It says:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"You have 340 customers who purchased once 45+ days ago and haven't returned. This is your highest-leverage win-back opportunity."</li>
              <li>"Your time-to-first-purchase is 12 days. Customers who don't convert by day 8 rarely convert at all. Here's where to intervene."</li>
              <li>"This segment is entering churn risk. Here's a campaign type that works for this pattern."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The platform identifies the intervention point. The customer executes the campaign.</strong></p>
            <p>And critically: this could be automated. Segment entry triggers the intervention. The system doesn't just surface insight—it acts on it.</p>
          </section>

            <h2>Why It Didn't Ship</h2>
            <p>Leadership validated the vision. The board approved. Product leadership aligned.</p>
            <p>But the data was foul. One-third of the time, our calculations of time to first purchase returned negative days—due to a backfill that had corrupted the underlying records.</p>
            <p>And the will wasn't there. The roadmap stayed incremental. The vision got shelved.</p>
            <p>A system is only as good as the infrastructure underneath it and the organizational capacity to execute it. I designed something that was strategically right and operationally impossible—not because the idea was flawed, but because the foundation (data) and the vehicle (org willingness) couldn't support it.</p>
            <p>This is why I now treat data integrity and organizational appetite as design constraints, not downstream concerns.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
            <p>The insight stands: <strong>ESPs are competing on the wrong layer.</strong></p>
            <p>More automations, more integrations, more templates—these are commodity features. The defensible product is the one that tells customers what to do and when to do it. The one that turns data into decisions.</p>
            <p>Klaviyo doesn't do this. Mailchimp doesn't do this. The entire category is stuck on "here's what happened" when the customer is asking "what should I do?"</p>
            <p>That's the future of the category, whether Drip builds it or someone else does.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study shows shipped features and measurable outcomes. This case study is about the system underneath—the model that turns email metrics into marketing intelligence—and the organizational reality that determines whether systems like this survive.</p>
