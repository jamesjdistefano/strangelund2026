            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Email is where work lives—and dies.</p>
            <p>Projects, decisions, people, documents, deadlines: all of it flows through email, accumulates in threads, and gets lost in volume. The average knowledge worker spends hours per day in email, most of it trying to extract the information that matters from the noise that doesn't.</p>
            <p>Grammarly had built a dominant position in writing assistance. But writing is only half the communication problem. The other half is reading—comprehending, synthesizing, and acting on the information buried in your inbox.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The question Grammarly brought to us:</strong> Can AI help people read email the way Grammarly helps them write it?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Constraint</h2>
            <p>This was 2022. Early days for applied AI in production consumer products. The question wasn't just "what should this do?" but "what can this do—technically, right now?"</p>
            <p>Before designing anything, I had to understand what Grammarly's AI could actually deliver:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Extractive summarization:</strong> Mark the most important sentences in an email</li>
              <li><strong>Abstractive summarization:</strong> Generate a new, condensed summary of content</li>
              <li><strong>Entity recognition:</strong> Detect people, projects, organizations, terms referenced in text</li>
              <li><strong>Question generation:</strong> Identify what questions an email answers (or raises)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These capabilities had different maturity levels. Some were production-ready. Some were experimental. The design had to account for what was real, not what was theoretically possible.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I designed a reading assistant that surfaces what matters and connects it to what you already know.</p>

            <h3>The Model: Entities and Summaries</h3>
            <p>I started by dissecting emails—different types, different purposes, different structures. What information do they contain? What would a human extract if they were taking notes?</p>
            <p>This gave me the entity model:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>People:</strong> Name, email, domain, relationship (internal/external, team, frequency of contact)</li>
              <li><strong>Organizations:</strong> Companies, clients, vendors referenced</li>
              <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Named initiatives, workstreams, recurring topics</li>
              <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Attachments, shared files, links to collaborative workspaces</li>
              <li><strong>Questions:</strong> What does this email ask? What does it answer?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Architecture</h3>
            <p>The system extracts entities from every email, relates them to each other, and builds a knowledge graph over time. When you read a new message, the assistant surfaces:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A summary of the thread</li>
              <li>The people mentioned, with context from past correspondence</li>
              <li>Related documents and prior conversations</li>
              <li>Questions the email raises or answers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The experience lives in a Chrome extension, overlaid on Gmail. Users opt in to ingestion. The system learns as you work.</p>

            <h3>The MVP</h3>
            <p>I defined the minimum viable version: "I save what's important. I give it context. Reader surfaces it when I write."</p>
            <p>Through collaboration with Grammarly engineers, I matched realistic capabilities to a concrete scope. We developed flow diagrams to visualize and communicate the product's integration into email, how a user might interact with it, and what benefit it would provide.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>In under six months, we went from idea to product definition to design to real, living code.</p>
            <p>Grammarly's developers implemented our designs in a Chrome extension, distributed inside the company and to our agency for testing and feedback.</p>
            <p>Our engagement ended before we saw the software released in the wild.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study would show you the UI mockups in Gmail. This case study is about what I actually designed: an entity model, a knowledge graph architecture, and a system for turning email history into contextual intelligence.</p>
