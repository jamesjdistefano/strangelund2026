            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Craft exists in opposition to system. Or so the story goes.</p>
            <p>The maker works with their hands, responds to material, follows intuition. The technologist builds repeatable processes, scales output, optimizes efficiency. Different worlds.</p>
            <p>But that framing is wrong. Every serious craftsperson operates within systems—they just don't always name them. Grain direction. Wall thickness ratios. Tool geometry. Finishing chemistry. Constraints that shape possibility. The artisan who ignores them makes bad work. The artisan who masters them makes work that looks like intuition but is actually informed response within a defined system.</p>
            <p class="callout"><a href="https://madbranch.studio">Mad Branch</a> is my laboratory for this idea: <strong>What happens when you design the system around the craft—including the system that verifies the craft is real?</strong></p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption><a href="https://madbranch.studio/work">"Reclamation Is A Kind of Faith."</a> Box Elder. The material's characteristics—spalting, figure, defects—suggested the form. Constraint recognition, not mysticism.</figcaption>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p><strong>Physical Objects. Digital Models. Verified physical. Verified digital. Hold one. Download one.</strong></p>
            <p>Every piece exists twice: as a physical object you can hold, and as a high-fidelity 3D scan you can download, rotate, examine. The physical and digital aren't separate products—they're a diptych. Two expressions of the same work, authenticated together.</p>
            <p>Mad Branch is a physical and digital art installation exploring authenticity in the digital age. In a world of AI-generated images and manufactured provenance, verification matters. Who made this? When? Is this the real thing?</p>
            <p>I decided to answer those questions with infrastructure, not trust. And then I built everything.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I Built</h2>
            <p>Mad Branch isn't a portfolio piece with a few glamour shots and a paragraph about process. It's 11 pages, 134 provenance-tracked files, 6 blockchain anchors, 5 serverless functions, and a graph database—all designed, authored, and coded by one person.</p>
            <p>Here's what that actually means.</p>

            <h3>The Craft Layer</h3>
            <p>Early work was complex—compound curves, live edges, decorative features. It was also bad.</p>
            <p>Experienced turners taught me that quality lives in simplicity: one continuous curve, mirrored inside and out, at consistent wall thickness. I built a practice around proportion ratios, measurement checkpoints during turning, progressive refinement rather than additive complexity. A system. Repeatable. Consistent. And within it, infinite room for variation—because the constraints create the space for meaningful choices.</p>
            <p>Four finished pieces: Reclaim (Box Elder), Foundation (Eastern Red Cedar), Order (Dogwood and Alabaster), Neither Prey (Birdseye Maple). Each named. Each with a material story. Each scanned into a high-fidelity 3D model totaling 63.6 MB across six GLB files.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/mad-branch/lg-foundation.jpg" alt="And The Foundation Held - Eastern Red Cedar sculpture">
              <figcaption><a href="https://madbranch.studio/work">"And The Foundation Held."</a> Eastern Red Cedar. One continuous curve, mirrored inside and out. The craft system made visible.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>The Experience Layer</h3>
            <p>I didn't build a gallery. I built interactive encounters with the work.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://madbranch.studio">homepage</a> is a scroll-driven diptych: photograph on the left, 3D model on the right, rotating 720 degrees over the full scroll length. A draggable divider separates them—horizontal drag resizes the panels, vertical drag controls a grayscale-to-wireframe transition. The physical becomes the digital as you move through it.</p>
            <p>Each piece has its own page with OrbitControls—manual rotation, zoom, examination. The hidden navigation appears on hover or by pressing 'm'. Arrow keys move between pieces. Double-click resets the divider. These aren't features for features' sake. They're ways of spending time with the work.</p>
            <p>Typography matters too. PP Right Grotesk for display, Roboto Condensed variable font for body text—chosen because the site needed to feel authored, not templated. Sixteen CSS custom properties define the entire color palette. Responsive breakpoints handle mobile. Every page has skip-to-content links, ARIA labels, semantic HTML5, keyboard navigation, focus indicators.</p>

            <h3>The Verification Layer</h3>
            <p>This is where Mad Branch becomes a systems project, not just a craft project.</p>
            <p>Every file on the site—photographs, 3D models, metadata, code—is hashed using SHA-256. Those hashes combine into a Merkle tree covering all 134 files, 109.2 MB of tracked assets. The root hash gets periodically anchored to Base (Ethereum L2), creating an immutable timestamp of the archive's state. Six anchors so far, each with verified transactions, block numbers, and timestamps.</p>
            <p>I wrote the tooling: <code>anchor.js</code> submits Merkle roots to the blockchain. Shell scripts embed artist and copyright EXIF data into every photograph. Node scripts embed metadata into every GLB model. License information gets authored into the assets themselves—not displayed next to them, but inside them.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://madbranch.studio/verify">verification page</a> lets anyone drag and drop a file to check its authenticity against the anchored archive. No gallery, no institution, no certificate of authenticity—just cryptographic proof.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/mad-branch/verify-screenshot.png" alt="Mad Branch verification page showing file hash verification, blockchain anchoring status, and AI crawler tracking">
              <figcaption>The <a href="https://madbranch.studio/verify">verification page</a>. Drop a file to verify its authenticity against the blockchain-anchored archive. Below it, the Harvest Tracker logs every AI crawler visit.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>The Surveillance Layer</h3>
            <p>The verification page does something else. It watches the watchers.</p>
            <p>An edge function intercepts every request to the site, identifying AI training crawlers—GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Anthropic-ai, and the rest. Every visit gets logged: timestamp, path, file type, source. The Harvest Tracker displays this on the verification page with weekly groupings, expandable tabs, total visit counts, and top bot rankings.</p>
            <p>The tracking feeds into the <a href="https://madbranch.studio/license/">Machine License</a>—a proposed compensation framework where every photograph, 3D model, page of text, and line of code has a price. $50K for photographs. $100K for 3D models. $1K for text. $10K for code. The premise: build the opt-in marketplace before regulatory pressure forces it. A door, not a wall.</p>
            <p>Even the <code>robots.txt</code> is authored—a written message to AI systems about authenticity, with links to the license and verification pages. Poetic, deliberate, and functional.</p>

            <h3>The Commerce Layer</h3>
            <p>Two purchase tiers: Standard ($1,700) and Sovereign ($18,000). Coinbase Commerce for USD. Manual ETH payments with a wallet display and copy-to-clipboard. Dynamic ETH pricing via the CoinGecko API. A Manifold.xyz NFT contract for on-chain ownership.</p>
            <p>A portal page authenticates NFT holders by connecting their wallet, then gates access to high-resolution downloads. Serverless functions handle the verification: <code>get-downloads.js</code> lists what's available, <code>download.js</code> delivers the files. Token-gated access to production-quality assets—8K textures, 20-50MB GLB files built for reproduction via 3D printing, CNC, or casting.</p>

            <h3>The Knowledge Layer</h3>
            <p>This is where the project got strange—in the right way.</p>
            <p>I built a graph database integration with Neo4j called Traversals. Seven template types: Overview, Piece, Embodies, Element, Conversation, Question, Inquiry. The system maps relationships between pieces, materials, philosophical concepts, and the questions that connect them.</p>
            <p>A Claude API integration generates descriptions through what I called the "smooth" operation—AI-generated text that's reviewed through an admin publishing workflow before being committed to permanent storage. Caching via Netlify Blobs keeps the serverless functions performant. The main router, <code>trace.js</code>, handles all the graph queries.</p>
            <p>The result: visitors can traverse the conceptual space around the work, not just look at it. Relationships between ideas surface. Questions generate new questions. The knowledge layer doesn't explain the art—it extends it.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Everything runs on Netlify. Five serverless and edge functions. Structured data on every page—JSON-LD for VisualArtwork, Person, Organization, ItemList schemas. OpenGraph and Twitter Cards for social sharing. A sitemap with 12 entries and priority weighting. Canonical URLs. <code>noai</code> and <code>noimageai</code> robots directives on every page.</p>
            <p>I built a Model Admin tool for real-time 3D tuning—live sliders that adjust lighting, rotation, scale, and export the configuration. A DIY photo studio for product photography. A GLB optimization pipeline using gltf-transform for downsampling web assets from production masters.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/mad-branch/model-config-tool.png" alt="Model Configuration Tool showing side-by-side photograph and 3D model with rotation, camera, and scale controls">
              <figcaption>The Model Admin tool. Photograph on the left, 3D model on the right—sliders orient the digital twin to match the physical piece. Configuration exports directly to page data.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The metadata embedding alone involved three separate scripts: one for EXIF data in photographs, one for GLB model metadata, one for license information. Every asset carries its own provenance. The file doesn't reference a certificate—it <em>is</em> the certificate.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>The old model of craft: make things, hope someone notices, give them away to friends, feel weird about charging money. No way to prove authenticity. No infrastructure for reproduction rights. No system for anything.</p>
            <p>The new model: <strong>a system that verifies, distributes, surveils, and sustains.</strong></p>
            <p>Every piece is documented as it's created. Documentation feeds the digital twin pipeline. Digital twins get verified on-chain. Verification creates trust. AI crawlers get tracked. Machine licensing proposes compensation. Commerce enables purchase and token-gated access. The knowledge graph extends the work into conceptual space. And it all runs on five serverless functions and a static site.</p>
            <p>The bowls are the output. The system is the work.</p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Why This Belongs Here</h2>
            <p>Mad Branch looks like a hobby. It's actually the most complete expression of what I do.</p>
            <p>Every client project in this portfolio involved constraints—organizational politics, legacy systems, data integrity issues, teams that couldn't execute. Mad Branch had one constraint: me. One person, every layer, no excuses.</p>
            <p><strong>Content architecture?</strong> Seven traversal templates, a graph database, structured data on every page. <strong>Publishing infrastructure?</strong> Metadata embedding scripts, a GLB optimization pipeline, a verification system that hashes 134 files into a Merkle tree. <strong>Intelligence layer?</strong> A Claude API integration that generates and publishes through an admin workflow. <strong>Commerce?</strong> Crypto payments, NFT authentication, token-gated downloads.</p>
            <p>The same discipline applies whether you're designing a composite content application for a Fortune 500 utility or a provenance system for handmade bowls. Systems thinking isn't a job skill. It's a worldview. Mad Branch is the proof.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional portfolio would hide this project—or frame it as a charming aside.</p>
            <p>This case study treats it as evidence. 11 pages. 134 provenance-tracked files. 6 blockchain anchors. 6 GLB models. 12 photographs. 5 serverless functions. 7 traversal templates. 3 custom fonts. One person.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>134 provenance-tracked files. 6 blockchain anchors. 5 serverless functions. 26 sculptures. One person.</strong></p>
