            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Mailchimp's customers knew how to use Mailchimp. They didn't know how to do marketing.</p>
            <p>The product had a detailed knowledgebase answering questions about buttons and dials. But knowing how to create a campaign doesn't tell you why to create one, or what to say, or who to say it to, or when.</p>
            <p>Instructional content for beginners was woefully out of date—often flat out incorrect. More recent, valid content was hosted on a separate server with a fraction of the traffic. Most importantly, help wasn't available where you needed it: right in front of you, in the application, while working on a campaign.</p>
            <p><strong>The question:</strong> How do you teach people why to do marketing, not just how to use your tool?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I founded and led a department producing educational content—not product documentation, but domain education. Marketing education.</p>

            <h3>The Distinction</h3>
            <p>Product knowledge lives in the knowledgebase: "Click here to add a merge tag."</p>
            <p>Domain knowledge lives in educational content: "Why segmentation matters more than list size."</p>
            <p>Mailchimp already had the first. I built the second.</p>

            <h3>The Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>We audited all existing content: Keep, Edit, or Kill. Surviving content was modeled for structure inside a CMS we built. I designed a customized WordPress installation with custom fields to match our content model.</p>

            <h3>The Stray Cat Program</h3>
            <p>You can't produce good educational content without a mechanism for the team to acquire real expertise. I instituted a program where team members could adopt "stray cat" topics—areas of marketing they'd teach themselves and then teach customers. The result: people who actually knew their subjects, not content writers faking expertise.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Channel Distribution</h3>
            <p>Educational content wasn't siloed on a blog. We built a publishing system to distribute content throughout the Mailchimp ecosystem—in-app, in onboarding, in email nurture sequences, on social. The same underlying content, surfaced where it mattered.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>The old model: Customers learn the product. They figure out marketing on their own. Churn happens when they can't translate tool knowledge into business results.</p>
            <p>The new model: <strong>Customers learn marketing through the product.</strong> The platform doesn't just enable campaigns—it teaches you why those campaigns matter.</p>
            <p>This is the difference between a tool and a system. A tool helps you execute. A system helps you understand what to execute and why.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study would show you guides and blog posts and video content. This case study is about the system underneath: the content model, the expertise acquisition mechanism, the distribution infrastructure that turns domain knowledge into customer capability.</p>
