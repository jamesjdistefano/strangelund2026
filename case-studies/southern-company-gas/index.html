            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Southern Company Gas operates a parent brand and four regional utilities. Each has its own site, its own content needs, its own stakeholders—but they're all saying versions of the same things: safety information, rate updates, service announcements, corporate communications.</p>
            <p>The existing approach: each site maintained independently. Same content rewritten multiple times. Inconsistent messaging. No shared infrastructure. Every update multiplied by five.</p>
            <p>Production of assets involved multiple groups both inside and outside the company. Publishing required external vendor assistance. Even simple copy edits underwent process—they couldn't "just change the copy" on their own.</p>
            <p>So vexing was this problem that a separate content unit became the lingua franca of corporate communications: the PDF file. Content devolved to delivery via PDF—not because it was the best format for messaging customers, but because it was the one that could be controlled from start to finish.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The question:</strong> How do you unify content production, design, and publishing across five properties without creating five times the work?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I led a small team in building what we called a "composite content application"—a publishing infrastructure that separates content from presentation and enables multi-site deployment from a single source.</p>

            <h3>Content Governance</h3>
            <p>We developed systems that solicited and approved content ideas, created a production process spanning writing, editing, and visualization, and allowed publishing to one or more websites. We taught our philosophy to internal employees and outside agencies responsible for asset production.</p>

            <h3>Content Model</h3>
            <p>Using Google's Zero Moment of Truth framework, we uncovered questions a user would ask, wrote answers, removed redundancies, and arranged content from very broad questions to very specific ones. Promotional pages answered broad questions. Leaf pages answered specific questions about a subject.</p>

            <h3>Design System</h3>
            <p>I translated brand guidelines into a component system in Figma for wireframes and content collection. Our authoring system was flexible, customizable, and reflected in full in Figma. We could cobble together wireframes in minutes, using them for content collection as well as communicating scope.</p>

            <h3>Publishing Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>I wrote code for components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside the Vue.js framework. Gridsome built our static pages. I maintained an NPM package to share code across properties, modeled content types in Contentful, wrote GraphQL to extract content, integrated SendGrid and Twilio to capture data, and handled DevOps in Netlify.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>The old model: Five sites means five sets of content, five update cycles, five chances for inconsistency.</p>
            <p>The new model: <strong>Author once, publish everywhere.</strong> A single content source that inherits brand-specific styling at the publishing layer. Update a safety guideline once; it propagates to all four regional sites and the parent.</p>
            <p>We designed pages with external search and accessibility in mind—proper structural code, partnered alt text with images, designed with proper contrast, and ensured accessible usability.</p>
            <p>The system scales content production while reducing effort. The business gets consistency without redundancy. The customer gets current information regardless of which regional site they visit.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study would show you the five homepages and talk about the visual design decisions. This case study is about the layer underneath: the content model, the governance system, the publishing logic that makes "author once, publish many" possible.</p>
