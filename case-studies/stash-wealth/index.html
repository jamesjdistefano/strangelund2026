            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Financial services has a gap.</p>
            <p>Big firms want clients with $500,000. Robo-advisors race to the bottom on price, treating everyone the same. In between sits the HENRY—High Earner, Not Rich Yet. Too wealthy for basic tools. Not wealthy enough for white-glove service.</p>
            <p>Stash Wealth built a high-touch, human-centered practice to serve this gap. Real advisors. Real relationships. Real plans tailored to real lives. It worked beautifully.</p>
            <p>It also didn't scale.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The question:</strong> How do you grow a business whose value proposition is human attention—without destroying the thing that makes it valuable?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I came in as Fractional CXO to answer that question. The answer wasn't "add technology." It was "design a system that lets humans do what only humans can do."</p>

            <h3>Business Strategy</h3>
            <p>Defined the competitive position: not robos (efficiency, commodity), not big firms (scale through standardization), but high-touch, relevant, human service. This became the filter. If an initiative supported human service at scale, it was a contender. If it replaced human service with automation, into the icebox.</p>

            <h3>Brand Strategy</h3>
            <p>Stash Wealth's voice was already its greatest asset—sassy, direct, human. I codified it. Developed the theme and direction, worked with a brand designer to extrapolate a design system. The website, the software, the collateral—all expressions of one voice.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/stash-wealth/sw-color.png" alt="Stash Wealth brand color palette showing vibrant, approachable colors">
              <figcaption>The brand color system. Vibrant and approachable—a deliberate contrast to the muted, "serious" palettes of traditional financial services.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/stash-wealth/sw-design-01.png" alt="Stash Wealth website design showing the brand system in application">
              <figcaption>The brand system applied to the website. Sassy, direct, human—every visual element reinforces the voice.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Technology Strategy</h3>
            <p>Identified where technology was creating friction for humans (advisors re-typing data, clients struggling with document signing) and removed it. Then designed the components that would let advisors do more, not be replaced:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Money Map:</strong> Visualizes income distribution for clients</li>
              <li><strong>Magic Number:</strong> Displays discretionary income—money that can be spent without compromising goals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These aren't robo-advisor features. They're tools that make human conversations more powerful.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/portfolio/stash-wealth/sw-mn-wires-02.png" alt="Magic Number wireframe showing discretionary income visualization">
              <figcaption>Magic Number wireframe. The tool that answers the question every client actually asks: "How much can I spend without screwing up my future?"</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>The old model: human service is expensive. To scale, you either raise minimums (exclude people) or automate (commoditize).</p>
            <p>The new model: <strong>design systems that multiply human capacity.</strong> Technology handles data ingestion, document flow, visualization. Humans handle judgment, empathy, accountability.</p>
            <p>Stash Wealth can serve more HENRYs without becoming less human. The system scales. The service doesn't dilute.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study shows the website and the Money Map interface.</p>
            <p>This one is about the layer underneath: a business strategy that filters decisions, a brand system that expresses voice, a technology architecture that amplifies humans instead of replacing them.</p>
