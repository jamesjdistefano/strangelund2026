            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Financial services has a gap.</p>
            <p>Big firms want clients with $500,000. Robo-advisors race to the bottom on price, treating everyone the same. In between sits the HENRY—High Earner, Not Rich Yet—too wealthy for basic tools, not wealthy enough for white-glove service.</p>
            <p>Stash Wealth built a high-touch, human-centered practice to serve this gap. Real advisors. Real relationships. Real plans tailored to real lives. It worked beautifully.</p>
            <p>It also didn't scale.</p>
            <p><strong>The question:</strong> How do you grow a business whose value proposition is human attention without destroying the thing that makes it valuable?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I came in as Fractional CXO to answer that question. The answer wasn't "add technology." It was "design a system that lets humans do what only humans can do."</p>

            <h3>Business Strategy</h3>
            <p>Defined the competitive position—not robos (efficiency, commodity), not big firms (scale through standardization), but high-touch, relevant, human service. This became the filter: if an initiative supported human service at scale, it was a contender. If it replaced human service with automation, into the icebox.</p>

            <h3>Brand Strategy</h3>
            <p>Stash Wealth's voice was already its greatest asset—sassy, direct, human. I codified it. Developed the theme and direction, worked with a brand designer to extrapolate a design system. The website, the software, the collateral—all expressions of one voice.</p>

            <h3>Technology Strategy</h3>
            <p>Identified where technology was creating friction for humans (advisors re-typing data, clients struggling with document signing) and removed it. Then designed the components that would let advisors do more, not be replaced:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Money Map:</strong> Visualizes income distribution for clients</li>
              <li><strong>Magic Number:</strong> Displays discretionary income—money that can be spent without compromising goals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These aren't robo-advisor features. They're tools that make human conversations more powerful.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enables</h2>
            <p>The old model: Human service is expensive. To scale, you either raise minimums (exclude people) or automate (commoditize).</p>
            <p>The new model: <strong>Design systems that multiply human capacity.</strong> Technology handles data ingestion, document flow, visualization. Humans handle judgment, empathy, accountability.</p>
            <p>Stash Wealth can serve more HENRYs without becoming less human. The system scales. The service doesn't dilute.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study would show you the website and the Money Map interface. This case study is about what I actually designed: a business strategy that filters decisions, a brand system that expresses voice, and a technology architecture that amplifies humans instead of replacing them.</p>
            <p><strong>I didn't add technology to a financial services firm. I designed a system that lets humans scale.</strong></p>
