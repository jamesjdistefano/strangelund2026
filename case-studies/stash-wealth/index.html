            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Financial services has a gap.</p>
            <p>Big firms want clients with $500,000. Robo-advisors like Betterment race to the bottom on price, treating everyone the same. In between sits the HENRY—High Earner, Not Rich Yet. Too wealthy for basic tools. Not wealthy enough for white-glove service.</p>
            <p>Stash Wealth built a high-touch, human-centered practice to serve this gap. Real advisors. Real relationships. Real plans tailored to real lives. It worked beautifully.</p>
            <p>It also didn't scale.</p>
            <p>The bottleneck was operational. A new client filled out a printed intake form—penciled-in numbers, handwritten goals. An advisor transcribed that form into spreadsheets. The spreadsheets fed financial planning software. The advisor then built handmade charts for the client meeting—custom visualizations of where money should flow and how much was safe to spend. For a couple with complex finances, intake alone could take days.</p>
            <p>Stash Wealth couldn't compete with mega-firms on scale. It couldn't compete with Betterment on price. Its only defensible position was custom-designed expertise delivered by a human. But every hour an advisor spent transcribing penciled numbers was an hour not spent delivering that expertise.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The question:</strong> How do you grow a business whose value proposition is human attention—without destroying the thing that makes it valuable?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>I came in as Fractional CXO to answer that question. The answer wasn't "add technology." It was "design a system that lets humans do what only humans can do—and stop making them do everything else."</p>

            <h3>Business Strategy</h3>
            <p>The competitive landscape had three lanes: mega-firms competing on scale, robos competing on price, and Stash Wealth competing on human expertise. Every decision filtered through that position. If an initiative amplified human service, it was a contender. If it replaced human service with automation, into the icebox.</p>
            <p>This sounds simple. It wasn't. The pressure to automate was constant—every fintech competitor was adding chatbots, self-service portals, algorithmic recommendations. The discipline was knowing which of those moves would erode the one thing clients were paying for.</p>

            <h3>Brand Strategy</h3>
            <p>Stash Wealth's voice was already its greatest asset—sassy, direct, human. The opposite of every financial services firm that communicates in compliance-approved gray. My job wasn't to invent the voice. It was to systematize it.</p>
            <p>I wrote the brand guide and worked with a designer to translate it into a visual system and printed materials. Then I extended the voice across every channel: the website, a video series, a podcast, blog posts, email sequences, digital and traditional marketing assets. The brand guide became the content strategy. Every touchpoint spoke the same way—because the system defined how.</p>

              <figcaption>The brand color system. Vibrant and approachable—a deliberate contrast to the muted, "serious" palettes of traditional financial services.</figcaption>

              <figcaption>The brand system applied to the website. Sassy, direct, human—every visual element reinforces the voice.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Technology Strategy</h3>
            <p>The first move was small: digitize the printed intake forms into PDFs. Clients could fill them out before the meeting. Advisors stopped transcribing pencil marks. It wasn't software. It was a reduction in manual labor that bought back hours per client.</p>
            <p>The larger vision was two tools designed to turn Stash Wealth's proprietary methodology into software:</p>
            <p><strong>Money Map</strong> visualized how income flows through a client's financial life—into accounts, sub-accounts, goal accounts. The concept was Stash Wealth's intellectual property: a system that "spends your money before you do," pre-allocating every dollar so the client doesn't have to make daily decisions about where money goes. Advisors had been building these as handmade charts for client decks. The software would generate them from data.</p>
            <p><strong>Magic Number</strong> was built on a specific insight: people treat financial planning like dieting. All restriction. Save more, spend less, deny yourself until retirement. Research showed this framing causes clients to disengage from their own plans. The Magic Number inverted it—a single padded discretionary income figure that answered the question every HENRY actually asks: "How much can I spend without screwing up my future?" Below it, you're fine. Above it, you're borrowing from future-you. One number. Permission instead of restriction.</p>

          </section>

            <h2>What Got Built and What Didn't</h2>
            <p>The brand system shipped. The voice extended across every channel. The intake process improved. Advisors got hours back.</p>
            <p>The software didn't ship. Money Map and Magic Number stayed in design. Non-technical founders underestimate how hard it is to build software—especially in an industry where every data field and every client interaction carries compliance weight. Then COVID hit, budgets contracted, and resources were redirected.</p>
            <p>The lesson isn't about what didn't launch. It's about where the leverage was. Stash Wealth's methodology was already excellent. The constraint wasn't the quality of advice—it was the cost of delivering it. Every hour spent on manual transcription, handmade charts, and unstructured intake was an hour stolen from the human interaction clients were paying for.</p>
            <p>The system I designed would have turned proprietary methodology into scalable software while keeping the advisor at the center. The brand system I built made sure every channel spoke with the same voice. The technology strategy identified where automation serves humans and where it replaces them—and held the line.</p>
            <p>Not everything ships. The thinking still holds.</p>
