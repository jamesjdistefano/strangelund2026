            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Turner Broadcasting had a black hole.</p>
            <p>From 1 A.M. to 5 A.M. on TBS, nothing aired. Dead air. A block of time that neither earned nor lost money compared to whatever programming might fill it. Expensive infrastructure, zero utilization.</p>
            <p class="callout"><strong>The question:</strong> What could you build in a space where failure costs nothing and success creates a new business?</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The System</h2>
            <p>Four intrapreneurs (I was one) pitched an answer through corporate channels. $22 million over two years. Dedicated internal staff. A thesis: original content supported by community infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Super Deluxe became Turner's first network not attached to a cable channel.</p>

            <h3>The Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Original programming:</strong> Professional content, comedy-forward, skewed weird. Turner had money to spend; we spent it on artists.</li>
              <li><strong>Social infrastructure:</strong> Custom-built platform for interaction, discussion, engagement. Not a distribution channel—a community.</li>
              <li><strong>User-generated content:</strong> Creators could upload work and have it sit alongside professional programming. Same stage, same audience.</li>
              <li><strong>Crossover pipeline:</strong> Success on Super Deluxe meant potential migration to broadcast. The system created a path from internet weird to television real.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The dream realized: Super Deluxer Brad Neely's work crossed the chasm. "China, IL" debuted on Adult Swim.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What This Enabled</h2>
            <p>We built a brand from nothing to 2 million uniques a month. Beat VH1 and Funny or Die to market—in both timing and quality. Got tagged by Gawker as "The Internet's Arrested Development" (critical success, commercial failure—but you don't get that label without making something people cared about).</p>
            <p>Eventually merged into Adult Swim, the stronger brand commanding more ad dollars from the 18-24 male demo. The business logic won. But the proof of concept held: you could build culture in the dead space, and some of it would graduate to the mainstream.</p>

            <h2>What I Did</h2>
            <p>Director of User Experience and Community. Designed the platform's functionality. Managed community behavior and content submission. Threw parties and artist events. Iterated constantly. Learned more about content marketing, product design, and brand-building than any other project before or since.</p>

            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>A conventional case study would show you the homepage and the upload flow. This case study is about what I actually helped build: a thesis for turning dead air into cultural incubation, a platform architecture that put amateurs next to professionals, and a pipeline that could graduate internet success to broadcast television.</p>
