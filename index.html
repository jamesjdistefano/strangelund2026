        <p>You can feel when a product has a system underneath it. The features cohere. The content compounds. The interface expresses the logic instead of fighting it.</p>
        <p>Most products don't have this. Interfaces layered over ad-hoc decisions. They look better; they don't differentiate.</p>
        <p><strong>The work that differentiates rarely has an owner. I'm accountable for it.</strong></p>
