            <p>I've been in this field for over twenty years. I've led UX departments, built products from scratch, designed systems for Fortune 500 companies and scrappy startups. And at some point, I stopped using the title that's supposed to describe what I do.</p>
            <p>Not because I left the field. Because the field left me.</p>

            <h2>The Director Problem</h2>
            <p>User experience design has always had a definitional problem. Could an experience be designed? What does it mean to design an experience? What does an experience designer actually control?</p>
            <p>My answer has always been that designing experience is analogous to directing a movie. The director didn't write the story, run the camera, say the lines, do the stunts, capture the sound. The director establishes the vision, runs the tactical executions that comprise it, and shepherds the whole thing to fruition.</p>
            <p>That's what experience design meant to me. Not screens. Not flows. The vision that makes screens and flows coherent.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What Happened</h2>
            <p>The easy answer: screens are tangible. States are tangible. UI is tangible. Figma is a tool to realize them, so we moved into Figma and started calling that the work.</p>
            <p>The real answer: we started chasing scale before we had scale problems. We invented design systems for single-page projects. We optimized for consistency before we had anything worth being consistent about. The tools that solved imaginary problems became the definition of the job.</p>
            <p>I've created design systems that were used on exactly one page. I wonder sometimes if the effort of building modular component libraries outweighs the benefit when the final outcome is a series of simple screens. But that's what the industry decided UX meant: systematic production of interface artifacts.</p>

            <h2>The Turn</h2>
            <p>The project that changed how I work was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, back in 2009.</p>
            <p>Rock Hall had stakeholders everywhere—Cleveland executives, a New York board, downtown business owners, legacy consultants who wanted the work we'd won. Everyone had an opinion about what RockHall.com should be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"It should be tickets and tour dates."</li>
              <li>"It should be the Wikipedia of rock and roll."</li>
              <li>"It should be Web 2.0—ratings and comments."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All valid. All wrong.</p>
            <p>Every site has tickets and tour dates. Wikipedia already exists. And Rock Hall's entire value is that they decide who's in and who's out—letting users vote would undermine the authority that made the institution matter.</p>
            <p>We had to decide what the project actually was. Through research, interviews, and gut-level experience, I wrote the strategic position that defined everything: "Creating a dialogue around stories told from our perspective of authority."</p>
            <p>That single line became the filter. Every subsequent decision—content model, information architecture, CMS design, publishing workflow—flowed from it. The deliverable wasn't wireframes. It was a position that made all the wireframes make sense.</p>
            <p>I didn't know it at the time, but that was the turn. I stopped being a UX designer. I became someone who designs the system underneath the experience.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Narrowing</h2>
            <p>When I moved into SaaS at Mailchimp, I discovered something disturbing. They considered user experience to be research and literally nothing else. No translation into projects, no wireframes, no prototyping. Just "here is what users tell us."</p>
            <p>I thought they were insane.</p>
            <p>Turns out, almost every job since has thought exactly the same way. UX became a vertex in a triangle—research over here, visual design over there, development in the corner. The interdisciplinary translation layer disappeared. The role that was supposed to hold the vision got reduced to one input among many.</p>
            <p>I've spent the last decade watching the title shrink to fit job descriptions I don't recognize.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
            <p>I design systems that make experiences possible.</p>
            <p>Not the screens. The logic underneath. The probability model that knows which moments matter. The content architecture that lets one source publish everywhere. The strategic position that turns fifty competing opinions into one coherent direction.</p>
            <p>If you ask me to explain this without using "UX" or "designer," I'm not sure I can. Our industry still sees experience as fingers tapping screens. Maybe I'm six to twelve months ahead. I've often been guilty of that.</p>
            <p>But I know the situation I'm looking for: green field, weighty problem, no obvious solution, appetite for risk, aversion to parity. A place that wants to produce something different, not compete in the churn of feature parity.</p>
            <p>That's the 5% of opportunities I'm trying to find. The other 95% can have the title.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
            <p>Differentiation beats operationalization.</p>
            <p>The latter is a race to the bottom—competing on price when everyone has the same feature set. I used to think moving into leadership would solve this, but the uninspiring leaders I've worked alongside taught me it's just a perspective problem. People overemphasize the thing that is done versus the thing that is unique.</p>
            <p>We remember Prince and Queen because of how different they were for their times. Not because they executed well against industry standards.</p>
            <p>My advice to anyone feeling the same friction: pick up the guitar and play your songs, not someone else's. That's the only path to uncommoditized creativity I know.</p>
            <p>I stopped calling myself a UX designer because the title stopped meaning what I do. The work didn't change. The language just caught up.</p>
